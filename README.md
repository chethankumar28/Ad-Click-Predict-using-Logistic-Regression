# Ad-Click-Predict-using-Logistic-Regression
Logisitc Regression is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. If the estimated probability that an instance is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class 1, or else it predicts that it does not. This makes it a binary classifier.
